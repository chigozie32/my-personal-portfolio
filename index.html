    <h1>âœ¨<span>My</span> Tech Jour<span>ney</span></h1>
    <p> I began my journey into tech with pure curiosity and no prior experience, just a desire to understand how websites 
    and apps worked. I started small, learning
    HTML and CSS to build simple web pages. Luckly i discovered <a href="https://www.genesystechhub.com" target="_blank">Genesys Tech Hub</a>
    early on, and it quickly became a game-changer. With access to resources, a supportive enviroment and real mentorship, my learning speed up.
    Each project fueled my passion pushing me to explore Javascript, Github, responsive design and even mobile first
    development. From positioning images to creating full layouts. I embraced every mistake as a step forward.
    What began as casual practice evolved into serious learning, and before i knew it, i was creating polished user-friendly 
    webpages with confidence. <br><br>



    The journey wasn't always smooth, i faced several challenges that tested my patience and determination.
    From confusing erros to slow progress and moments of doubt, it would've been easy to give up. but i didn't.
    I kept learning, kept building, and kept pushing forward. Every obstacle became a lesson, and every breakthrough
    reminded me why i started. With support from <a href="https://www.genesystechhub.com" target="_blank">Genesys Tech Hub</a> and a growing passion for tech, i
    turned setbacks into stepping stones. Today, i stand more focused, more skilled, and more commited than ever.
